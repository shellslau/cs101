USEFUL UNIX COMMANDS AND EDITOR SKILLS

(especially since they will be on an exam)

UNIX

CAN YOU MATCH these interactive commands to their functions?
Also, it is a good idea to know how to exit each one.

emacs  evince  firefox  gdb  mail  man  more  vi  view

1. display file contents on terminal

2. browse an ascii file

3. edit a file

4. send a message, or read messages from others

5. browse a pdf file

6. access the Internet

7. get information on a command

8. debug your program in C

CAN YOU MATCH these non-interactive commands to their functions?

cd  cp  diff  gcc  grep  history  lpr  ls  make  man  mkdir  mv  pwd  rm

9. connect to a directory

10. copy a file or files

11. rename a file

12. delete a file

13. create a directory

14. compile with specified flags and files in C or other languages

15. move a file or files to a different directory

16. print a file on paper (somewhere)

17. display recent commands on terminal

18. display a list of commands relevant to a keyword

19. compare two files and print lines that differ

20. search for a string (or regular expression) in one or more files

21. display the name of the current directory

22. list file names, and perhaps properties, in current directory

23. compile C files



EDITOR SKILLS

Being proficient with your editor is important for getting your work
done in Computer Science.
You should know the answers for whatever editor you would use for these
tasks, and GIVE ITS NAME when you get these questions on an exam.

Describe a procedure in your editor to search for
a string, say ``node''.
    . How do you find the first occurrence?
    . How do you find subsequent occurrences WITHOUT RETYPING THE STRING?
    . Does the search wrap around?
    . How can you search backwards?

Describe a procedure in your editor to copy a portion of one file into
another file.  It must be able to copy more than one screenful, and copy
actual file contents (such as tab characters), not just their screen
appearance.  To be specific, say you want to copy lines 150 to 250 from
old.c into new.c.

Describe a procedure in your editor to copy a portion of one file into
another place in the same file.  To be specific, say you want to copy
lines 150 to 250 and insert them after line 300.

Describe a procedure in your editor to replace some, but not necessarily
all, occurrences of an old string with a new string.  (This is often
called ``query replace''.) Your method must involve typing the old
string and the new string ONLY ONCE EACH, so there is no possibility of
inconsistent replacements.

To be specific, say you want to replace ``Term'' by ``Symbol'' in selected
occurrences, even if the occurrence is not a whole word, but not if it
happens to be in ``Terminate'', ``Terminal''  and such.
