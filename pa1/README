I have read and understood the Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates, the related sections 102.01-102.016 and 105.15 of the UC Santa Cruz Student Policies and Regulations Handbook, and the related sections of the class syllabus.

I wrote this assignment using only permitted sources that do not require citation, according to the syllabus.

Right now, all i have is the intVec.c file and the intVec.h file. the IntVec.c file should implement all of the functions outlined in the intVec.h file, but I'm not sure all of them work.
